OLED96 is a simple C library for working with the SSD1306 128x64 OLED display
when connected to the I2C bus. This has only been tested on a RPi3.
The idea is to provide a simple interface for C programmers to make use of 
those low-cost OLED displays without having to read the data sheet or figure
out I2C programming.
