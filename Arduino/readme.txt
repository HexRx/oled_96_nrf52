This is the Arduino sketch version which works as an importable library.
Create a directory called oled_96 in your ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries 
directory and copy the oled_96.cpp and oled_96.h files there.
It will be available as a library to import into your Arduino Sketch.
On an AVR Arduino, the fonts+code take a total of 5368 bytes of program memory.
